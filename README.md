**BATCH DURATION**: JAN 5TH,2025 TO FEB 5TH,2025

**MENTOR NAME**: NEELA SANTHOSH

DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK:

This is a **responsive webpage** designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which adapts to various screen sizes to ensure optimal user experience across devices.

### Key Features:
1. **Header Section**:
   - Includes a title to welcome visitors.
   - Styled with a blue background and white text for a clean, professional look.

2. **Navigation Bar**:
   - A horizontal menu with links (e.g., Home, About, Services, Contact).
   - Adjusts to a vertical layout on smaller screens for better usability.

3. **Main Content**:
   - Contains a **services section** laid out in a grid format.
   - Uses CSS grid to create layouts:
     - **3 columns** on large screens.
     - Adjusts to **2 or 1 column** on medium or small screens.
   - Each service is displayed in a card with a light-gray background and rounded corners.

4. **Footer Section**:
   - Provides copyright information with a dark background to visually separate it from the rest of the page.

### Responsiveness:
- **Media Queries** in CSS ensure the layout adapts based on the screen width:
  - For devices under 768px (e.g., mobile), grids collapse into single columns.
  - For devices between 769px and 1024px (e.g., tablets), the grid adjusts to 2 columns.

### Interactivity:
- JavaScript adds click functionality to the service cards, showing an alert when clicked, enhancing engagement.

This structure ensures an intuitive, visually appealing, and device-friendly design for users.
